# grates 0.1.2.9000 (Development version)

* This is a breaking release that changes the underlying implementations of the
  different grate constructors and associated scales for ggplot2. There has also
  been some renaming of function arguments to bring greater consistency across
  packages.
* We now make more use of the high level API introduced by the 
  [clock](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=clock) package for working with
  R's date and date-time types.

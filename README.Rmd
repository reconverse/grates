## Introduction

grates is an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package designed to make it easy to
group dates across a range of different time intervals. It defines a collection
of classes and associated methods that, together, formalise the concept of
grouped dates and are intuitive to use.

## Installing the package

You can install the latest release of grates from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("grates")
```

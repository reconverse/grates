\arguments{
\item{x}{An object to coerce to monthly.}

\item{interval}{An integer indicating the (fixed) number of months used for
grouping; defaults to 1 month.}

\item{origin}{The date to anchor the intervals from.  If NULL (default)
the earliest date in the vector will be used. If specified, \code{origin} must
have the same class as x.}

\item{...}{Not currently used.}

\item{format}{\verb{[character / NULL]}

A format string. A combination of the following commands, or \code{NULL},
in which case a default format string is used.

A vector of multiple format strings can be supplied. They will be tried in
the order they are provided.

\strong{Year}
\itemize{
\item \verb{\%C}: The century as a decimal number. The modified command \verb{\%NC} where
\code{N} is a positive decimal integer specifies the maximum number of
characters to read. If not specified, the default is \code{2}. Leading zeroes
are permitted but not required.
\item \verb{\%y}: The last two decimal digits of the year. If the century is not
otherwise specified (e.g. with \verb{\%C}), values in the range \verb{[69 - 99]} are
presumed to refer to the years \verb{[1969 - 1999]}, and values in the range
\verb{[00 - 68]} are presumed to refer to the years \verb{[2000 - 2068]}. The
modified command \verb{\%Ny}, where \code{N} is a positive decimal integer, specifies
the maximum number of characters to read. If not specified, the default is
\code{2}. Leading zeroes are permitted but not required.
\item \verb{\%Y}: The year as a decimal number. The modified command \verb{\%NY} where \code{N}
is a positive decimal integer specifies the maximum number of characters to
read. If not specified, the default is \code{4}. Leading zeroes are permitted
but not required.

\strong{Day}
\itemize{
\item \verb{\%d}, \verb{\%e}: The day of the month as a decimal number. The modified

\item \verb{\%G}: The ISO week-based year as a decimal number. The modified command
\verb{\%NG} where \code{N} is a positive decimal integer specifies the maximum number
of characters to read. If not specified, the default is \code{4}. Leading zeroes
are permitted but not required.
\item \verb{\%V}: The ISO week-based week number as a decimal number. The modified
command \verb{\%NV} where \code{N} is a positive decimal integer specifies the maximum
number of characters to read. If not specified, the default is \code{2}. Leading
zeroes are permitted but not required.
\item \verb{\%u}: The ISO weekday as a decimal number (\code{1-7}), where Monday is \code{1}.
The modified command \verb{\%Nu} where \code{N} is a positive decimal integer
specifies the maximum number of characters to read. If not specified, the
default is \code{1}. Leading zeroes are permitted but not required.
}

\strong{Week of the year}
\itemize{
\item \verb{\%U}: The week number of the year as a decimal number. The first Sunday
of the year is the first day of week \code{01}. Days of the same year prior to
that are in week \code{00}. The modified command \verb{\%NU} where \code{N} is a positive
decimal integer specifies the maximum number of characters to read. If not
specified, the default is \code{2}. Leading zeroes are permitted but not
required.
\item \verb{\%W}: The week number of the year as a decimal number. The first Monday
of the year is the first day of week \code{01}. Days of the same year prior to
that are in week \code{00}. The modified command \verb{\%NW} where \code{N} is a positive
decimal integer specifies the maximum number of characters to read. If not
specified, the default is \code{2}. Leading zeroes are permitted but not
required.

\code{-0430} refers to 4 hours 30 minutes behind UTC. And \code{04} refers to 4 hours
ahead of UTC. The modified command \verb{\%Ez} parses a \code{:} between the hours and
minutes and leading zeroes on the hour field are optional:
\verb{[+|-]h[h][:mm]}. For example \code{-04:30} refers to 4 hours 30 minutes behind
UTC. And \code{4} refers to 4 hours ahead of UTC.
\item \verb{\%Z}: The full time zone name or the time zone abbreviation, depending on
the function being used. A single word is parsed. This word can only
contain characters that are alphanumeric, or one of \code{'_'}, \code{'/'}, \code{'-'} or
\code{'+'}.

\verb{\%a \%b \%d \%H:\%M:\%S \%Y}.
\item \code{\%\%}: A \verb{\%} character.
\item \verb{\%n}: Matches one white space character. \verb{\%n}, \verb{\%t}, and a space can be
combined to match a wide range of white-space patterns. For example \code{"\%n "}
matches one or more white space characters, and \code{"\%n\%t\%t"} matches one to
three white space characters.
\item \verb{\%t}: Matches zero or one white space characters.
}}

\item{locale}{\verb{[clock_locale]}

A locale object created from \code{\link[clock:clock_locale]{clock_locale()}}.}
}
\value{
A \code{grate_month} object.
}
\description{
\itemize{
\item Date, POSIXct, and POSIXlt are converted, with the timezone respected,
using \code{\link[clock:as_date]{clock::as_date()}}.
\item Character input is parsed using \code{\link[clock:date_parse]{clock::date_parse()}}.
}
}
\note{
Internally \code{grate_month} objects are stored as the number of months
(starting at 0) since the Unix Epoch (1970-01-01).

as_month(Sys.Date())
as_month(as.POSIXct("2019-03-04 01:01:01", tz = "America/New_York"), n = 2)

\item{...}{Not currently used.}

\item{format}{\verb{[character / NULL]}

A format string. A combination of the following commands, or \code{NULL},
in which case a default format string is used.

A vector of multiple format strings can be supplied. They will be tried in
the order they are provided.

\strong{Year}
\itemize{
\item \verb{\%C}: The century as a decimal number. The modified command \verb{\%NC} where
\code{N} is a positive decimal integer specifies the maximum number of
characters to read. If not specified, the default is \code{2}. Leading zeroes
are permitted but not required.
\item \verb{\%y}: The last two decimal digits of the year. If the century is not
otherwise specified (e.g. with \verb{\%C}), values in the range \verb{[69 - 99]} are
presumed to refer to the years \verb{[1969 - 1999]}, and values in the range
\verb{[00 - 68]} are presumed to refer to the years \verb{[2000 - 2068]}. The
modified command \verb{\%Ny}, where \code{N} is a positive decimal integer, specifies
the maximum number of characters to read. If not specified, the default is
\code{2}. Leading zeroes are permitted but not required.
\item \verb{\%Y}: The year as a decimal number. The modified command \verb{\%NY} where \code{N}
is a positive decimal integer specifies the maximum number of characters to
read. If not specified, the default is \code{4}. Leading zeroes are permitted
but not required.
}

\strong{Month}
\itemize{
\item \verb{\%b}, \verb{\%B}, \verb{\%h}: The \code{locale}'s full or abbreviated case-insensitive
month name.
\item \verb{\%m}: The month as a decimal number. January is \code{1}. The modified command
\verb{\%Nm} where \code{N} is a positive decimal integer specifies the maximum number
of characters to read. If not specified, the default is \code{2}. Leading zeroes
are permitted but not required.
}

\strong{Day}
\itemize{
\item \verb{\%d}, \verb{\%e}: The day of the month as a decimal number. The modified
command \verb{\%Nd} where \code{N} is a positive decimal integer specifies the maximum
number of characters to read. If not specified, the default is \code{2}. Leading
zeroes are permitted but not required.
}

\itemize{
\item \verb{\%a}, \verb{\%A}: The \code{locale}'s full or abbreviated case-insensitive weekday
name.
\item \verb{\%w}: The weekday as a decimal number (\code{0-6}), where Sunday is \code{0}. The
modified command \verb{\%Nw} where \code{N} is a positive decimal integer specifies
the maximum number of characters to read. If not specified, the default is
\code{1}. Leading zeroes are permitted but not required.
}

\strong{ISO 8601 week-based year}
\itemize{
\item \verb{\%g}: The last two decimal digits of the ISO week-based year. The
modified command \verb{\%Ng} where \code{N} is a positive decimal integer specifies
the maximum number of characters to read. If not specified, the default is
\code{2}. Leading zeroes are permitted but not required.
\item \verb{\%G}: The ISO week-based year as a decimal number. The modified command
\verb{\%NG} where \code{N} is a positive decimal integer specifies the maximum number
of characters to read. If not specified, the default is \code{4}. Leading zeroes
are permitted but not required.
\item \verb{\%V}: The ISO week-based week number as a decimal number. The modified
command \verb{\%NV} where \code{N} is a positive decimal integer specifies the maximum
number of characters to read. If not specified, the default is \code{2}. Leading
zeroes are permitted but not required.
\item \verb{\%u}: The ISO weekday as a decimal number (\code{1-7}), where Monday is \code{1}.
The modified command \verb{\%Nu} where \code{N} is a positive decimal integer
specifies the maximum number of characters to read. If not specified, the
default is \code{1}. Leading zeroes are permitted but not required.
}

\strong{Week of the year}
\itemize{
\item \verb{\%U}: The week number of the year as a decimal number. The first Sunday
of the year is the first day of week \code{01}. Days of the same year prior to
that are in week \code{00}. The modified command \verb{\%NU} where \code{N} is a positive
decimal integer specifies the maximum number of characters to read. If not
specified, the default is \code{2}. Leading zeroes are permitted but not
required.
\item \verb{\%W}: The week number of the year as a decimal number. The first Monday
of the year is the first day of week \code{01}. Days of the same year prior to
that are in week \code{00}. The modified command \verb{\%NW} where \code{N} is a positive
decimal integer specifies the maximum number of characters to read. If not
specified, the default is \code{2}. Leading zeroes are permitted but not
required.
}

\strong{Day of the year}
\itemize{
\item \verb{\%j}: The day of the year as a decimal number. January 1 is \code{1}. The
modified command \verb{\%Nj} where \code{N} is a positive decimal integer specifies
the maximum number of characters to read. If not specified, the default is
\code{3}. Leading zeroes are permitted but not required.
}

\strong{Date}
\itemize{
\item \verb{\%D}, \verb{\%x}: Equivalent to \verb{\%m/\%d/\%y}.
\item \verb{\%F}: Equivalent to \verb{\%Y-\%m-\%d}. If modified with a width (like \verb{\%NF}),
the width is applied to only \verb{\%Y}.
}

\strong{Time of day}
\itemize{
\item \verb{\%H}: The hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number. The modified command
\verb{\%NH} where \code{N} is a positive decimal integer specifies the maximum number
of characters to read. If not specified, the default is \code{2}. Leading zeroes
are permitted but not required.
\item \verb{\%I}: The hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number. The modified command
\verb{\%NI} where \code{N} is a positive decimal integer specifies the maximum number
of characters to read. If not specified, the default is \code{2}. Leading zeroes
are permitted but not required.
\item \verb{\%M}: The minutes as a decimal number. The modified command \verb{\%NM} where
\code{N} is a positive decimal integer specifies the maximum number of
characters to read. If not specified, the default is \code{2}. Leading zeroes
are permitted but not required.
\item \verb{\%S}: The seconds as a decimal number. Leading zeroes are permitted but
not required. If encountered, the \code{locale} determines the decimal point
character. Generally, the maximum number of characters to read is
determined by the precision that you are parsing at. For example, a
precision of \code{"second"} would read a maximum of 2 characters, while a
precision of \code{"millisecond"} would read a maximum of 6 (2 for the values
before the decimal point, 1 for the decimal point, and 3 for the values
after it). The modified command \verb{\%NS}, where \code{N} is a positive decimal
integer, can be used to exactly specify the maximum number of characters to
read. This is only useful if you happen to have seconds with more than 1
leading zero.
\item \verb{\%p}: The \code{locale}'s equivalent of the AM/PM designations associated with
a 12-hour clock. The command \verb{\%I} must precede \verb{\%p} in the format string.
\item \verb{\%R}: Equivalent to \verb{\%H:\%M}.
\item \verb{\%T}, \verb{\%X}: Equivalent to \verb{\%H:\%M:\%S}.
\item \verb{\%r}: Equivalent to \verb{\%I:\%M:\%S \%p}.
}

\strong{Time zone}
\itemize{
\item \verb{\%z}: The offset from UTC in the format \verb{[+|-]hh[mm]}. For example
\code{-0430} refers to 4 hours 30 minutes behind UTC. And \code{04} refers to 4 hours
ahead of UTC. The modified command \verb{\%Ez} parses a \code{:} between the hours and
minutes and leading zeroes on the hour field are optional:
\verb{[+|-]h[h][:mm]}. For example \code{-04:30} refers to 4 hours 30 minutes behind
UTC. And \code{4} refers to 4 hours ahead of UTC.
\item \verb{\%Z}: The full time zone name or the time zone abbreviation, depending on
the function being used. A single word is parsed. This word can only
contain characters that are alphanumeric, or one of \code{'_'}, \code{'/'}, \code{'-'} or
\code{'+'}.
}

\strong{Miscellaneous}
\itemize{
\item \verb{\%c}: A date and time representation. Equivalent to
\verb{\%a \%b \%d \%H:\%M:\%S \%Y}.
\item \code{\%\%}: A \verb{\%} character.
\item \verb{\%n}: Matches one white space character. \verb{\%n}, \verb{\%t}, and a space can be
combined to match a wide range of white-space patterns. For example \code{"\%n "}
matches one or more white space characters, and \code{"\%n\%t\%t"} matches one to
three white space characters.
\item \verb{\%t}: Matches zero or one white space characters.

\value{
A \code{grates_quarter} object.

\itemize{
\item Date, POSIXct, and POSIXlt are converted, with the timezone respected,
using \code{\link[clock:as_date]{clock::as_date()}}.
\item Character input is parsed using \code{\link[clock:date_parse]{clock::date_parse()}}.

\note{
Internally \code{grates_quarter} objects are stored as the number of
quarters (starting at 0) since the Unix Epoch (1970-01-01)
